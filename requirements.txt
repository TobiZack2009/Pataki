Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Pataki
1. Overview
Pataki is an AI-powered health navigation and microinsurance platform designed to address the healthcare access and insurance discovery gap in Nigeria. It combines a multi-modal triage system with a seamless, voice-first insurance experience to guide users from symptom recognition to care access and payment—especially for underserved, low-literacy populations.
2. Problem Statement
•	Nigerians often delay seeking care due to misinformation, low digital literacy, and lack of insurance.
•	Insurance is seen as a “grudge purchase” and is rarely used until emergencies arise.
•	Pharmacies are often the first point of care, but users pay out-of-pocket until conditions worsen.
•	Insurers face high loss ratios due to late-stage claims and lack of preventive data.
3. Goals
•	Provide a simple, accessible AI triage system to guide users to the right care path.
•	Enable early detection and preventive action through daily health check-ins.
•	Offer a microinsurance model that is affordable, trusted, and seamlessly integrated.
•	Reduce insurer costs through AI vetting, behavioral nudges, and early intervention.
•	Build a health wallet that rewards users for proactive behavior and engagement.
4. Target Users
•	Low- and middle-income Nigerians, especially those in rural or semi-urban areas.
•	Users with low digital or medical literacy.
•	Partner HMOs and pharmacies seeking to reduce costs and expand reach.
5. Core Features (MVP Scope)
A. Multi-Modal Input
•	Voice Input: Users can speak in local dialects (starting with Pidgin or Yoruba).
•	Text Input: Simple chatbot interface for typed symptoms or questions.
•	OCR Input: Scan prescriptions or lab results using Tesseract.js or similar.
B. AI Triage Engine
•	Categorizes input into:
o	Clinical Path: Physical symptoms.
o	Psychological Path: Mental health concerns.
o	Information Path: Preventive health education.
•	Uses keyword-based logic to assign a risk score (Low, Medium, High).
C. Risk Intelligence
•	Analyzes user input over time to detect patterns.
•	Suggests possible causes and next steps.
•	Displays two nearby clinics or hospitals based on condition severity.
•	Triggers alerts for human-in-the-loop doctor review if risk is high.
D. Insurance Flow: “Pool & Protect”

•	Token Generation:
o	6-digit Pataki Care Code.
o	QR Code for pharmacy scanning.

o	Countdown timer for token validity.
•	Settlement: Pharmacy enters code, dispenses care, and is reimbursed from the pooled fund.
E. Health Wallet
•	Tracks weekly contributions and earned Pataki Credits.
•	Credits can be redeemed for consultations, medications, or emergency care.
•	Encourages consistent engagement and builds user trust.
6. User Flow (MVP Demo)
1.	User opens Pataki and selects input mode (voice, text, scan).
2.	AI triages the input and assigns a risk level.
3.	If risk is high, AI suggests causes and shows 2 nearby clinics.
4.	If user is insured, AI initiates vetting → doctor approves → token is generated.
5.	User visits pharmacy, presents QR/code → receives care.
6.	Pataki settles payment from pooled fund.
7.	User earns credits and sees them in their Health Wallet.
